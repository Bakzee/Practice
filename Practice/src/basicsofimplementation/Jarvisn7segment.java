/*All over the world, peoples are working on energy solution. It would be a tough time for our next generation to survive if we don’t think about solution. Tony stark is working on a new project and wants to display his project using “seven segment display - concept”. Tony Stark gave Jarvis a task to find a number from his Favorite list of number for which the energy consumption is lowest.

(Assuming that for a digit to represent Tony stark is using 7 bulbs and only those bulbs light up which are required to represent a number and rest other would be completely off.)

Help Jarvis and conserve energy.

Seven segment display - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display

enter image description here

Input:
First line will contain the number of test cases and for every test case first line will contain length of favorite list and the second line for a test case will contain n numbers

Output:
For every test case print the answer. If there exist more than 1 numbers for which same number of bulbs are required than output the number which occurs first in the Favorite list.

Constraints:
Test cases< 10
A[i] < 10^6
Size of list < 10^5

SAMPLE INPUT 
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
1
Explanation
Number 1 needs only two bulbs to represent.
